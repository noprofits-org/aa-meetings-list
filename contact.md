# Contact Information

## Seattle AA Meeting Updates

For corrections, updates, or additions to Seattle area meetings, please contact:

**Email**: [wtchair@seattleaa.org](mailto:wtchair@seattleaa.org)  
**Subject**: Meeting Directory Update

The data for this directory comes directly from the official Greater Seattle Intergroup database. Meeting changes need to be made in the source system to appear here (updates typically reflect within a week due to our automated rebuild schedule).

## Technical Questions & Development

For questions about the technical implementation, code, or replicating this system:

**Email**: [wtchair@seattleaa.org](mailto:wtchair@seattleaa.org)  
**Subject**: AA Directory Technical Inquiry

## Contributing Meeting Data for Other Regions

### For Other AA Intergroups

If you represent an AA Intergroup in another city or region and want to make your meetings searchable by AI assistants, we can help you:

1. **Assess Your Data**: Evaluate your current meeting management system
2. **Create Data Feeds**: Help establish machine-readable meeting data exports  
3. **Technical Implementation**: Provide guidance on setting up your own directory
4. **Integration Options**: Explore adding your region to this platform

**Contact**: [wtchair@seattleaa.org](mailto:wtchair@seattleaa.org)  
**Subject**: Regional Meeting Directory Setup

### For Developers & Technologists

If you're a developer who wants to implement this system for your region:

**Requirements**:
- Machine-readable meeting data (JSON, XML, or database access)
- Basic familiarity with static site generators
- GitHub account for hosting

**What We Provide**:
- Complete source code and documentation
- Setup guidance and best practices
- Technical support during implementation

**Contact**: [wtchair@seattleaa.org](mailto:wtchair@seattleaa.org)  
**Subject**: Developer Implementation Support

## Repository & Source Code

The complete source code for this project will be made available as an open-source repository. This includes:

- Haskell/Hakyll static site generator code
- Data processing and formatting functions  
- GitHub Actions automation workflows
- Documentation for replication

**Coming Soon**: GitHub repository link  
**Contact for Early Access**: [wtchair@seattleaa.org](mailto:wtchair@seattleaa.org)

## Reporting Issues

### Website Problems
- Broken links or display issues
- Missing or outdated meeting information  
- Mobile compatibility problems

### Data Accuracy
- Incorrect meeting times or locations
- Missing meetings that should be listed
- Meetings listed that no longer exist

**For All Issues**: [wtchair@seattleaa.org](mailto:wtchair@seattleaa.org)

## Response Times

- **Meeting Updates**: Changes are processed in the official Seattle AA system, then reflected here during the next automated build (typically within 1 week)
- **Technical Inquiries**: We aim to respond within 2-3 business days
- **Implementation Support**: Timeline varies based on complexity and region-specific requirements

## About This Initiative

This project is maintained by volunteers committed to making AA meeting information more accessible. We believe that removing technical barriers can help more people find the support they need in their recovery journey.

Our goal is to create a model that any AA region can implement to make their meetings discoverable by AI assistants and other automated systems, while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the official meeting data.
