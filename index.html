<h2>AI-Accessible AA Meetings Directory</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Seattle Area AA Meetings Directory – a searchable, AI-friendly resource for finding Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in the Greater Seattle area.</p>

<h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>

<p>When you ask AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini about AA meetings, they often can't help because most meeting websites load their data using JavaScript after the page renders. This makes the meeting information invisible to AI assistants and search engines.</p>

<p>The official <a href="https://seattleaa.org/meetings" target="_blank">seattleaa.org/meetings</a> site is an excellent resource for humans, but its JavaScript-loaded content can't be read by AI systems or web crawlers.</p>

<h3>Our Solution</h3>

<p>This directory solves that problem by generating static HTML pages with all meeting information embedded directly in the page content. Now AI assistants can read, search, and help people find AA meetings based on their needs – whether that's location, time, meeting type, or accessibility requirements.</p>

<h2>Meeting Directories</h2>

<p>Browse our comprehensive meeting listings, automatically updated weekly from the official Seattle AA database:</p>
