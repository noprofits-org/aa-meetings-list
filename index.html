<div class="ai-features">
<h3>ðŸ¤– Built for AI Accessibility</h3>
<p>This directory is specifically designed to work with AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Every meeting is accessible in small, digestible pages that AI can easily read and search.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Navigation:</strong> Find any meeting in 3 clicks or less</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Data:</strong> Complete meeting details including Zoom links, accessibility info, and directions</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Updates:</strong> Automatically refreshed from official sources</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Access Patterns:</strong> Browse by location, time, meeting type, or accessibility needs</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>

<p>When you ask AI chatbots about AA meetings, they often can't help because most meeting websites load their data using JavaScript after the page renders. This makes the meeting information invisible to AI assistants and search engines.</p>

<p>Traditional AA meeting websites are excellent resources for humans, but their JavaScript-loaded content can't be read by AI systems or web crawlers.</p>

<h3>Our Solution</h3>

<p>This directory solves that problem by generating static HTML pages with all meeting information embedded directly in the page content. Now AI assistants can read, search, and help people find AA meetings based on their specific needs.</p>
